# 1. Introduction
Imagine that John Doe works in a project along with 7-10 folks. John started 
working on this project from the beginning and therefore knows a lot more than everyone else in the project.

These leads to some problems such as:
1. John is the go-to person for each and every detail that the team needs. John has a lot of responsibility and work on his shoulders, making his individual progress sometimes slow.
2. Whenever John falls sick and goes on an unplanned leave, he is bugged by his team to keep things moving forward in the project.
3. The organisation finds it hard to replace John, and has therefore retained him twice in the past year by raising his compensation twice.

> In short, the project has a single point of failure -> John Doe


# 2. What is Bus Factor?

As per Wikipedia, The bus factor is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not 
being shared among team members, derived from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus". 
It is also known as the bread truck scenario, bus problem, beer truck scenario, lottery factor, truck factor, 
bus/truck number, or lorry factor.

In simple words, what is the probability of the project failing if John Doe gets hit by a bus and is not able to return to work? 
> Higher the bus factor higher the risk of failure. 


# 3. Reducing the Bus Factor in Software Development

## 3.1 Documenting
Creating and maintaining documentation can take a good amount of effort from all 
the stakeholders. But in the long run, it is worth documenting. Documenting includes Product Requirement
Documents(PRDs), High & Low level design documents, changelogs, READMEs, complete ticket descriptions on ticketing tools, 
Root Cause Analysis documents in case of production fires, etc

## 3.2 Code Reviews 
If done effectively, code reviews can act as an excellent tool to reduce the bus 
factor, given that everyone in the team gets a chance to review the code. 
The Engineering manager/team lead should make sure that there are relative code 
review guidelines setup as per the team so that it is effective enough.

## 3.3 Meetings
Yes, I know meetings sometime slow us down and hinder our productivity. Also, some meetings can 
just be replaced by an email. But, meetings (especially if you are working remotely) can act reduce the 
bus factor if done correctly. Meetings like standup, sprint planning/grooming, design discussions, 
sprint retros etc brings everyone together as a team. Imagine you reading a minute of meeting document vs
actually brainstorming in the meeting. Obviously, meetings do not replace documentation, instead the
documentation compliments the meeting process.

## 3.4 Team Process
Some other team processes like pair programming, office hours, on-call rotations, engineering demos 
and knowledge sharing sessions can distribute knowledge inside the organisation and reduce the bus factor.

## 3.5 Positive Work culture
A positive culture means employees are happy in the organisation and a better work environment is created. 
Following direct techniques can be applied to improve the work culture and reduce the bus factor:

### 3.5.1 Mandatory Paid Annual Vacation 
Most of the organisations provide paid leave to their employees. The organisations should also encourage
people to use these leaves and go on a vacation(for a week at least). This will enable other employees taking
care of work in the absence of an employee. 


### 3.5.2 Short Notice/Termination Period
A short notice period means, the organisation making sure that there is less dependency on an employee.
