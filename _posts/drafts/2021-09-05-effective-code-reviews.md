## Introduction
Code reviews (also called as peer review) is a process where a code feature is reviewed 
by other developers in the team before it is merged into master. Some of the benefits 
of code reviews(if done effectively) are:

- finding bugs and design flaws
- knowledge sharing
- less dependency on a single dev -> enable time-off
- mentor newer engineers
- consistent codebase

and more..


## Myths related to code reviews

the team. Teams that do not have a effective code review process at all are already moving
towards an unknown technical debt.

2. **Code reviews should only be done by senior developers:**

3. **If you have unit tests, then you dont need code review:**
