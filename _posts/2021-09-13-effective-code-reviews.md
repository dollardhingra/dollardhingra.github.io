Some popular myths related to code reviews are:
1. **Code Reviews are time-consuming:** This is the most common myth that people believe. Code reviews certainly need time to catch design issues & bugs and share knowledge across the team. Teams that do not have an effective code review process at all are already moving towards an unknown technical debt.
2. **Code reviews should only be done by senior developers:**
3. **If you have unit tests, then you don't need the code review:**


## Benefits of code reviews
Code review can reap a lot of benefits like:
1. **Finding bugs & design flaws:**
2. **Knowledge sharing**
3. **Reduced lottery factor**
4. **Clean & consistent codebase**: “Truth can only be found in one place: the code.” ― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
5. **Better estimations**
