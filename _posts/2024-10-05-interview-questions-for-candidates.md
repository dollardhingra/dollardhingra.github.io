Interviews aren’t just an opportunity for the company to evaluate you - they’re also your chance to learn more about the company. When the interviewer invites you to ask questions, instead of immediately seeking feedback on your performance, take the opportunity to ask thoughtful questions that will help you understand the company, its culture, and the role you’re applying for. 

Ask about the company's values, how teams are structured, and what cross-functional collaboration looks like. 

Example: "What’s something unique about the culture here that made you excited to join or stay with the company?"

### Learning and Career Growth
Inquire about learning opportunities, mentorship, and career progression within the organization.

Example: "How does the company invest in the long-term growth of its engineers, and are there pathways for IC and leadership roles?"

### Engineering Challenges and Problem-Solving
Show interest in the company’s technical challenges and ongoing projects.

Example: "Can you share a current project that excites the engineering team and why it’s impactful for the company?"

### Development Process and Feedback
Ask about the company’s development workflow, code reviews, and how feedback is provided.

Example: "What does the feedback process look like for engineers, both in terms of technical work and overall professional development?"

### Work-Life Balance and Expectations
Understand the company’s approach to work-life balance and the expectations for engineers.

Example: "What are the typical working hours or expectations for engineers here, and how does the company handle urgent issues or on-call rotations?"

### Tech Stack and Tools
Learn about the technologies and tools the team uses to ensure it aligns with your expertise and interests.

Example: "How does the team decide which technologies or frameworks to adopt, and how often do engineers have the chance to experiment with new tools?"

Remember, finalizing a job offer should go beyond just monetary factors—understanding the company's work environment, values, and long-term opportunities is equally important. The best interviews are two-way conversations that benefit both you and the company.
