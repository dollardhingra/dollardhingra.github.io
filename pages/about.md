# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a passionate software developer currently 
working in python as a web developer from Delhi, India. 
Apart from python I also have a good experience in Javascript writing 
front end code.<br>
I created this blog to share my thoughts on web development & good programming 
practices. I am not an expert in these topics but I think 
writing about these topics can help me in better learning & growth. 
Apart from coding I also like reading & working out. 

If you have a feedback about any of my articles or want to connect with me
professionally then please feel free to do so:<br>
