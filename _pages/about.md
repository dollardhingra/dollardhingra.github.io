Hi I am {{ site.author.name }} ðŸ‘‹,
I am a passionate software developer currently working at [TO THE NEW](https://www.tothenew.com/). 
I created this blog to share my thoughts on web development & good programming practices. I am not an expert in these topics but I think writing about these topics can help me in better learning & growth. Apart from coding I also like reading & working out.

If you have a feedback about any of my articles or want to connect with me professionally then please feel free to do so:
